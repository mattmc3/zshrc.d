> Load ZSH config files from a zshrc.d directory

## Description

This plugin allows you to source your .zshrc configuration from files in a directory.

So, instead of storing all your configuration settings in a single `~/.zshrc` file,
you can organize `.zsh` files in a `${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zshrc.d` directory and this
plugin will source them.

If using `$ZDOTDIR`, this plugin supports using the non-hidden `$ZDOTDIR/zshrc.d`
directory as an alternative, or you can set the `$ZSHRCD` to specify a custom
location.

## FAQ

_Q: Does this mean I can replace my `.zshrc` file entirely?_

**A: No, you will still need a `.zshrc` file for Zsh to run properly, but you can
reduce its contents to just the minimal code required to load this plugin and then use
your `.zshrc.d` directory for everything else.**

_Q: How can I ensure that my .zsh config files are loaded in the right order?_

**A: Files are sorted alphabetically by locale, the same as your `ls` command, so name
your files accordingly.**

_Q: How do I name files if I need them to load first?_

**A: One method is to prefix any files that have to load first with a numbering scheme
(ie: 00-99).**

_Q: How do I name files if I need them to load last?_

**A: One method is to prefix any files that have to load last with `zz-`, or `zz01-`.**

_Q: How do I keep a file in my zshrc.d directory, but prevent it from being sourced?_

**A: Files prefixed with a tilde (~) are skipped by this plugin.**

_Q: What names can I use for my `.zshrc.d` directory?_

**A: `${ZDOTDIR:~}/.zshrc.d`, `$ZDOTDIR/zshrc.d`, `$ZDOTDIR/conf.d`, and `$ZDOTDIR/rc.d` are supported by default. If you want a different directory, you should set the `$ZSHRCD` variable.**

## Customizing

If you want to use an alternate path, add set the `$ZSHRCD` variable prior to sourcing
this plugin:

```zsh
ZSHRCD=~/path/to/my/custom/zshrc.d
```
